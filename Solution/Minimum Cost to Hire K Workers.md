# Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers

## üìú Problem Description
Given `n` workers represented by their qualities and minimum wage expectations, this algorithm aims to hire exactly `k` workers to form a paid group. The group must adhere to the following rules:
- Each worker must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
- Within the group, each worker's pay must be proportional to their quality.

## üõ†Ô∏èApproach
1. Calculate the wage to quality ratio for each worker and sort them in ascending order of ratio.
2. Initialize variables: `minCost` to track the minimum cost, `qualitySum` to track the total quality of the selected workers, and a max heap to maintain the highest quality workers.
3. Iterate through the sorted workers:
   - Add the worker's quality to `qualitySum`.
   - Push the quality of the worker to the max heap.
   - If the size of the max heap exceeds `k`, pop the highest quality worker from the heap and subtract their quality from `qualitySum`.
   - If the size of the max heap equals `k`, update `minCost` with the minimum of the current cost and the ratio multiplied by the total quality.
4. Return `minCost`.

### üí°Intuition
The algorithm sorts workers by their wage to quality ratio. It then iterates through the sorted workers, maintaining a maximum heap of worker qualities. At each step, it calculates the total quality sum of the group and updates the minimum cost if the group size equals `k`.

### ‚è∞Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting the workers and building the heap.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the heap and other variables.
